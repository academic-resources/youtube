If you are using a local deployment, it is recommended that you concatenate and minify all the
JavaScript source files for performance reasons. You can do this by running

  node r.js -o app.build.js

from within this top-level directory; it will output a static-min/ directory containing the
optimized JavaScript, which you can then serve. More information about this process, including
the dependencies you need to install to run those commands, can be found at
