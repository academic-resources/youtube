/**
 * @fileoverview Closure shim module for YTS typings.
 *
 * You can import 'yts' in a YTS test module:
 *   import 'yts';  // gives global yts namespace
 *
 * That code compiles into a goog.require() statement, which is
 * satisfied by this file.
 *
 * YTS test modules are loaded by YTS Agent, which in turn provides
 * implementation for 'yts' global namespace.
