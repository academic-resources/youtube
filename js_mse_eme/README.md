# js_mse_eme

js_mse_eme is an externally-published tool that is aimed to test the validity
of a browser's HTML5 Media Source Extension and Encrypted Media Extension
implementations. As an added bonus, this tool is used by YouTube to certify
hardware electronic devices (e.g. TVs, settop boxes, etc...).

Previously, year specific tests and tools were maintained in their respective 
branches. Going forward only the master branch will be updated.
